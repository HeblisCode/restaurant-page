# Restaurant Website

### [Live Preview](https://hebliscode.github.io/restaurant-page/) <br>

The focus of this project was to organize the JavaScript code in different modules and use the ES6 modules to build each tab of the website. <br>
First try at implementing some basic animations.<br>

### Future projects:

- make it responsive
- add more menu cards making the menu scrollable
